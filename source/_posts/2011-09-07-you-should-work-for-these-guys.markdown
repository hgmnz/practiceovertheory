For the last few months [we've](http://thoughtbot.com) been on a team working for an awesome company on a greenfield project.

The space: Healthcare. The goal: Improve patient's lives by changing the way the entire system works.

### The stack

Rails 3.1, Backbone.js, Coffeescript, Cucumber, RSpec and Jasmine.

### The process

Daily standups, TDD, code reviews via github pull requests.

### The result

A highly responsive non-trivial app with a very clean code base and beautiful design.

The future holds a mobile app, web service integrations and improvements to the current code base.

If you live in the Boston area, you should apply. If you don't, you should move. [Right here](http://thoughtbot.com/jobs/iora/developer/)
