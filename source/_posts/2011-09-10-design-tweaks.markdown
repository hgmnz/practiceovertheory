Today I made a few design tweaks to this blog. The goals was to move a bit away from the stock default octopress theme - but my design chops aren't all that great and I can't really budget the time to do a design from scratch.

A few simple changes and I'm OK with how it looks for now:

1. I created the basic font logo that you now see on the header. This was the idea from the beginning, but I never had a chance to include it here. Commit: [27d0107f](https://github.com/hgimenez/practiceovertheory/commit/27d0107fe1165f61cfd72f17717a674575ca4fc9).

2. Change the typography in the site. I started out by using a Helvetica Neue on headers, but decided to go with Antic from the Google web font service. Commits: [2dd8f46b4](https://github.com/hgimenez/practiceovertheory/commit/2dd8f46b46a4c848ea4debbeeeda8e9ce23fcb0a) and [84bad437]( https://github.com/hgimenez/practiceovertheory/commit/84bad437716a8c0e78b1354b0f61876e1cd9a988).

3. I wanted something different for that dark background. Went hunting for tiles and patterns. There's good stuff out there, but I settled for the dark wood background found [here](http://webtreats.mysitemyway.com/8-tileable-dark-wood-texture-patterns/). Commit: [9593a00431](https://github.com/hgimenez/practiceovertheory/commit/9593a004317f1fdc57a386373b3210262bd029b0). At this point, it also made sense to make the header and footer have a light background and dark font.

4. Finally, added a gradient to the header. Commit [fe918b0e](https://github.com/hgimenez/practiceovertheory/commit/fe918b0e9681bbc9c7af21980a4c585698feaf09)

I'm fine with the result for now, but will probably revisit soon. Here's a before and after.
